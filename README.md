# SJK's trove of treasures

_AKA Etch's mass of mysteries_

In these hallowed halls you will find a series of documents that describe helpful little tips and tricks for messing around with Algorand.

These are small scripts, mainly in the form of jupyter notebooks, that I've written, because writing stuff to use the algorand API and SDK is really quite easy.
Hopefully it'll be useful, and inspirational for you.

An important disclaimer.
I am by no means an expert, I'm learning and so I may well (and will) make mistakes.
Please test and double check eveything I tell you.
I take no responsibility for anything you publish to the blockchain and/or run.

## About me

By day I'm a web app developer, based in Australia.
However, I'm really excited about Web3 and so in my spare time have taken it upon myself to try and learn about it.
As part of it, I've taken over lead development of the [NFT Grocery Store Game](https://www.algochainnft.com/grocery), and I'm now beginning to work on my own bot, and alogrand utility service.

## About these docs

My general attitude to software development is that I build big complex things in Javascript/Typescript/Node.js, and I write simple scripts/fixes/experiments in python.
As such, these tips, being simple scripts/fixes/experiments, will be mostly written in the latter.

Fortunately, there's this amazing thing called Jupyter.
This whole guide is actually written in it.
It's a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) that allows me to easily experiment and write short little tid-bits alongside my code.
It makes it perfect for both my personal experiments, and to use as a tool to help bring others on the journey.

As such, I recommend you start by setting up jupyter yourself, so you can easily follow along, and customise what I've written.

## The good stuff

So you've skipped straight to the good stuff hey?
Good call, that's what I would have done.

Everything written in here assumes you're set up like follows:

* [Getting Started With Jupyter](./export/getting_started_with_jupyter.md)
* [Env File and API](./export/env_file.md)

Once your set up, feel free to pick whatever you fancy.

* [Creating ASAs and NFTs](./export/creating_asas.md) - including ARC-69
* [Sending ASAs](./export/sending_assets.md) - including opting in, and sending assets in batches
* [Experiment: Burning ASAs](./export/burning_asas.md)

## Other Algorand Things by SJK

* [Vanity Address Generator](https://github.com/sjk0-9/AlgorandVanityAddressGenerator)

## Misc:

I've generated a wallet using the vanity address generator. If you've found anything I've done helpful, feel free to send some Algo its way.
