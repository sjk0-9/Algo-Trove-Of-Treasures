    "# Burning ASAs\n",
    "\n",
    "Something I've seen people want to do is burn assets in Algorand.\n",
    "Make it so that some percentage of the asset is permanatly inaccessible.\n",
    "This could be used to make a token more valuable.\n",
    "Or to reduce a collection after it's released to increase rarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "While other blockchains have some mechanism that allows something like that,\n",
    "Algorand does not.\n",
    "There is no \"burn\" transaction which destroys assets.\n",
    "And since you have to explicitly opt-into assets, you can't send the assets to a junk wallet.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one method I have thought of however, that I haven't seen people talking about.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorand has something called \"Re-Keying\".\n",
    "It allows you to hand complete authority over your wallet, to some other wallet.\n",
    "This is generally used for cases where you want to use a hardware wallet like a ledger device.\n",
    "Or if you're worried your private key has been compromised.\n",
    "However, one important part of it, is that it doesn't require the other wallet to agree.\n",
    "So in theory, by rekeying your wallet to an account you don't have control over,\n",
    "you lose access to all assets stored in your wallet, effectively burning all of your assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process to do this is like follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate a new algorand address\n",
    "2. Send minimum required Algo to that address: 0.101 per asset for opt in transaction and minimum balance + base of 0.1\n",
    "3. Opt into every asset you want to burn with the new address\n",
    "4. For the last opt-in, set the `rekey` property to a known inaccessible account.\n",
    "    You can now no longer perform transactions with this account.\n",
    "5. Send all assets you want to burn to this new account.\n",
    "    No one will ever be able to access them again.\n",
    "    \n",
    "I'll write up and annotate a python method that can do this process down below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only real question is what is a \"known inaccessible account\"?\n",
    "You could generate a random 32 bytes, add a checksum and convert to Base32 and you'd have a valid algorand address that no one has access to.\n",
    "However you can't prove to anyone else that it isn't a real wallet you secretly created.\n",
    "\n",
    "My best proposal for how to do this, is use a wallet everyone already trusts as being inaccessible.\n",
    "Early in algorand's development, the following address was randomly generated as part of the \"Early Redemption Burn\"\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "FRWQZO4A6NZKANEYYWAHZIBHJ46T2LVRFACCLHUY3JQAJLUIWNQQLOQ26A\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Details for how they generated the address, and more about the burn can be found [here](https://algorandfoundation.cdn.prismic.io/algorandfoundation/5c80fdd2-fe08-4bda-8ac5-981b37908031_Early+Redemption+Confirmation.pdf).\n",
    "The important thing, is that because of the way the address was randomly generated, there is no corresponding private key. Rekeying to this address will hopefully satisfy an observer that you don't have access to the account anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "(I also tried testing with the zero address, but that didn't seem to work properly).\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a few caveates to this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The obvious... there's no reversing the process, that's the point, once they're gone, they're gone.\n",
    "* Services don't know these assets have been burnt. They'll still appear in circulation and affect things like total market cap.\n",
    "    That said, if you are manager over those assets, you can work around this by updating the reserve address so it points to\n",
    "    the burn wallet.\n",
    "    That only works however if you don't have any other reserves you want to maintain.\n",
    "    Also not all services take the reserve address into consideration anyway.\n",
    "* If you are the asset manager and you want to totally destroy the asset instead of just a cetain amount of it,\n",
    "    it's better to use the Asset Configuration Transaction to delete the asset from the chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disclaimer\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Important:** You will be **permanantly** removing access to a wallet.\n",
    "> When using this code double, triple, quadruple check that this is the wallet and assets you intend to burn.\n",
    "> Don't just blidly use it.\n",
    "> There is no way you can get it back.\n",
    "> Just forget about it.\n",
    "> Don't come asking for a way to reverse the process.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Don't blindly trust the burn address I've given you.\n",
    "> Verify it with official sources and recalculate if need be.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The code and instructions in this demonstration is released under the MIT license and as such has no warantee or guarantees that it is fit for purpose.\n",
    "> I am in no way responsible for anything you do to your assets or wallets just because you read it here.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that out of the way, let's dive in."
